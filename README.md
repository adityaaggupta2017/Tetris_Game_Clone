# Tetris Game Clone

Welcome to our Tetris game clone repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python and the Pygame library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. You can install Pygame using the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
Game Controls

    Left Arrow Key: Move the Tetris piece to the left.
    Right Arrow Key: Move the Tetris piece to the right.
    Down Arrow Key: Move the Tetris piece down faster.
    Space Key: Rotate the Tetris piece.
    Escape Key: Restart the game.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to complete horizontal lines by filling them with Tetris pieces. When a line is completed, it disappears, and you earn points. The game ends if the Tetris pieces reach the top of the screen.
### Code Structure

  - project_main.py: This file contains the main logic for the Tetris game. It defines the Figure and Tetris classes responsible for creating and managing Tetris pieces and the game board.
  - project_main2.py: This file handles user input and game events. It listens for key presses and updates the game state accordingly.

## Customize the Game

Feel free to explore and modify the code to add new features, change colors, or enhance the gameplay. We encourage contributions and improvements to make this Tetris clone even more enjoyable!
